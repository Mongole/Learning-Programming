This began late March 2025 and was finished May 02 2025 (had to focus on other stuff in april)

Overview

This is an analysis of the data job market, following Luke Barousses tutorial 'Python for Data Analytics - full course for beginners'.
This provided insight into the job market for different data related roles, from different job titles to salaries and requiered skills. Through the use of python scripts, key questions where explored to extract data such as most demanded skills, salary trends, and comparisons between different job roles, between other analytics performed.

The Questions

Below are the questions that were explored following the tutorial;

    1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
    2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
    3.How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
    4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying)

Tools I Used

Several tools were used for this analysis into the data analyst job market:

    • Python: The programming language used for the analysis, the following Python Libraries were the most used:
        º Pandas: Used to analyze the data
        º Matplotlib: used to visualize the data
        º Seaborn: Used to create more advanced visuals (mostly formatting)
    •Jupyter Notebooks: The tool used to run python scripts
    •Visual Studio Code: Program used for executing python scripts
    • Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my python code and analysis

What I Learned

Throughout this project I gained knowledge on how to use python for data manipulation and visualization. I also gained an understanding of the data analyst job market.
Here are a few specific things I learned:

    • Advanced Python Usage: Utilized different python libraries to perform complex data analysis tasks.
    • Data Cleaning Importance: I learned that data manipulation can be performed more thorough through crucial data cleaning and preparation.
    • Strategic Skill Analysis: The project emphasized the importance of aligning one's skills with the market demand.

Insights

This project provided several general insights into the data job market for analysts:
    • Skill Demand and Salary Correlation: There is a clear correlation between the demand for specific skills and the salarires these skills command.
    • Market Trends: There are changing trends in skill demand, such as an existing or new technology becomming more popular/in-demand, leading to a decline of another. These changes accentuate the need to keep up with these trends for career growth.
    • Economic Value of Skills: Understanding which skills are both in-demand and well-compensated can guide data analysts in prioritizing learning to maximize their economic returns.

Challenges Faced

This project had its challenges which lead to good learning opportunities:

    • Data inconsistencies: Encountering missing/inconsistent data entries, which required different data cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity of the analysis.
    • Complex Data Visualization: Designing effective visual representations of complex datasets was challenging.
    • Balancing Breadth and Depth: Deciding how deeply to dive into each analysis while maintaining a broad overview of the data landscape.

Conclusion:

The use of this tutorial provided ample knowledge in the use of python for data analytics and visualization. Following Luke's lead into the exploiration of the data analyst job market, I gained an understanding of how different technologies can lead to more career oportunities, while gaining valuable insight deep diving into the job market.
